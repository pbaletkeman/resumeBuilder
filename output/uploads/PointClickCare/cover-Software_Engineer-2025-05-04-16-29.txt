Dear Hiring Team,

I am writing to express my strong interest in the Data Software Engineer position at PointClickCare, as advertised on [Platform where you saw the job posting - e.g., LinkedIn].  With over two decades of experience developing robust software solutions and a proven track record of delivering impactful results within complex systems, I’m confident that my skills and expertise align perfectly with your requirements.

Throughout my career, I've consistently focused on building scalable and efficient applications – most recently at Rakuten Kobo where I developed custom Java and Python RESTful APIs for a reporting platform, resulting in a 20% reduction in manual developer intervention and improved fraud detection capabilities.  This experience directly mirrors the need for advanced data ingestion, processing, modeling, and reporting that PointClickCare is seeking.

My expertise includes:

*   **Cloud Technologies (AWS/Azure):** I've gained practical experience deploying applications across various environments utilizing Docker and Kubernetes on both AWS and Azure, directly addressing the need for cloud infrastructure expertise.

Furthermore, my background includes significant experience with database design and optimization – including SQL Server tuning - as well as NoSQL technologies like MongoDB.  I’m a self-starter who thrives in collaborative environments and is comfortable tackling new challenges, as evidenced by my mentorship of junior developers and proactive identification of software bugs. 

I am particularly drawn to PointClickCare's commitment to employee growth and professional development, and the opportunity to contribute to your mission of improving healthcare outcomes.  Thank you for considering my application. I have attached my resume for your review and welcome the chance to discuss how my skills can benefit your team.
