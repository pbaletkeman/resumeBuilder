1.  **Skills to Add:** Consider adding specific experience with Azure DevOps or AWS CloudFormation for infrastructure-as-code. Also, explicitly state your proficiency in data warehousing concepts (e.g., ETL processes). Adding a mention of Spark or Hadoop would also be beneficial given the big data focus.
2.  **Certifications/Courses:** Pursue certifications related to cloud technologies (Azure Fundamentals, AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner) and DevOps practices (Docker & Kubernetes certification). A course on Data Engineering fundamentals could significantly strengthen your profile.
3.  **Project Ideas:** To better align with PointClickCare’s focus on data analytics, consider creating a personal project involving data ingestion from a public dataset (e.g., COVID-19 data), data transformation using Spark or Python, and building a simple dashboard visualizing the insights. This demonstrates practical experience with the technologies mentioned in the job description.  Another option would be to build a small microservice application utilizing Spring Boot and deploying it on Kubernetes.
