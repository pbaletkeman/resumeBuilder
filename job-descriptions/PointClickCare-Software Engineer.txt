What does a typical day look like for a Data Software Engineer?

 You would be responsible for designing, developing, implementing, and supporting our emerging big data analytics capabilities through the development and maintenance of advanced data ingestion, processing, modeling and reporting capabilities.
 The majority of your day would be spent working with a cross-functional team of developers, product leaders, to specify, design, develop, test, and implement software.
 We’re huge on professional development, and so there’s always a training class, hackathon, or an internal course being offered.
